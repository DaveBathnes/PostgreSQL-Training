GIS data types
==============

| Format | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| GeoJSON | Based on JSON, often used in web development. |
| KML | XML based open standard. |
| GML | XML based.  An open spatial data schema to enable interoperability between independent GIS applications and with internet GIS in mind |
| Shapefile | Proprietary and popular ESRI file format. |
| CSV | Data held in traditional CSV files |

GeoJSON
-------

| Aspect | Details |
| ---- | ---- |
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation.   |
| Lightweight | Text based, and not too much markup |

```
{ "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
      { "type": "Feature",
        "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]},
        "properties": {"prop0": "value0"}
        },
      { "type": "Feature",
        "geometry": {
          "type": "LineString",
          "coordinates": [
            [102.0, 0.0], [103.0, 1.0], [104.0, 0.0], [105.0, 1.0]
            ]
          },
        "properties": {
          "prop0": "value0",
          "prop1": 0.0
          }
        },
      { "type": "Feature",
         "geometry": {
           "type": "Polygon",
           "coordinates": [
             [ [100.0, 0.0], [101.0, 0.0], [101.0, 1.0],
               [100.0, 1.0], [100.0, 0.0] ]
             ]
         },
         "properties": {
           "prop0": "value0",
           "prop1": {"this": "that"}
           }
         }
       ]
     }
```

KML
---

| Aspect | Details |
| ------ | ------- |
| XML | eXtensible Markup Language  |
| Google | Developed for use with Google Earth, which was originally named Keyhole Earth Viewer |
| Open | KML became an international standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium in 2008 |


Shapefiles
----------

| Aspect | Details |
| ---- | ---- |
| Proprietary | ESRI based standard |

CSV
---

| Aspect | Details |
| ------ | ------- |
| WKT | Tend to include GIS data through the use of Well Kown Text standard, or alternatively simple X/Y values in separate columns |

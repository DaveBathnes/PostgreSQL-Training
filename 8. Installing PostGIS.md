Installing PostGIS
==================

PostGIS needs to be installed separately to the main PostgreSQL install.

The recommended way of installing PostGIS is via the PostGIS site.  Be careful to choose a version that is compatible with your version of PostgreSQL.

2. Run through the installer selecting all the defaults.

PostGIS is now installed!

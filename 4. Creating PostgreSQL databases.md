Creating PostgreSQL databases
=============================

It is easy to create databases in postgreSQL using either the GUI, or by directly running SQL queries.

Creating a database
-------------------

- In pgAdmin 4 Connect to the database server.
- In the server tree select the postgres database.
- Open up the query tool.  Tools > Query Tool.
- Create a new database using the following query.  Once you've written the query click the Lightning icon to run.

```
create database example;
```

On refreshing the server tree by right clicking and selecting 'Refresh' you will see the new database.  From now on we'll do everything on this database.

An alternative to this would be to use the GUI.  Right click on databases and select Create.

Creating a table
----------------

- [Create Table Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html)

Databases are made up of tables.  To create these we can either run SQL statements or use the GUI.

```
CREATE TABLE films (
    code        char(5),
    title       varchar(40),
    did         integer,
    date_prod   date,
    kind        varchar(10),
    len         interval hour to minute,
    CONSTRAINT code_title PRIMARY KEY(code,title)
);
```

Data types
----------

One of the most important considerations in creating databases is the data types used in tables.  Here are a selection of commonly used PostgreSQL data types.

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| character varying(10)/varchar(10) | variable-length with limit |
| character(10)/char(10) | fixed-length |
| text | variable unlimited length |
| integer | non decimal number -2147483648 to +2147483647  |
| numeric | up to 131072 digits before the decimal point; up to 16383 digits after the decimal point |
| serial | auto-incrementing integer |
| date | a date value |
| timestamp | a date and time value |
| integer array/integer[] | 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional arrays of a specified type |

Loading data
------------

Data can be manually loaded into PostgreSQL.

Postgres also allows for loading in data using the COPY command.  Typically this will be loaded into individual tables from CSV data.

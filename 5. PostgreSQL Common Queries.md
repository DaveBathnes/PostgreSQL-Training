PostgreSQL Common Queries
=========================

Brief overview of selecting and querying data in PostgreSQL.  Many of these commands will be similar/identical to commands run in other database servers e.g. SQL Server, Oracle.

Using the pgAdmin 4 GUI
-----------------------

1. In the pgAdmin explorer navigate in the tree to Databases > Training > Schemas > Public > Tables
2. Right click on the postcodes table and select View All Rows

Selecting data
---------------

- [Select Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-select.html)

Select particular columns from the data table.  In the case below, just the postcode and positional quality indicator.

```
select postcode, positional_quality_indicator from postcodes;
```

Where clauses
-------------

Filter the data by specifying values that columns must conform to.  In the case below, where the postcode begins 'EX'.

```
select * from postcodes where postcode LIKE 'EX%';
```


Order By
---------

Modify the order in which the data is returned.  In the case below, postcodes sorted in reverse alpabetical order.

```
select postcode from postcode order by postcode desc;
```

Group By
--------

Commonly used for aggregating and counting data.  In the case below, count postcodes by first two letters.

```
select substring(postcode, 1, 3), count(*) from postcodes group by substring(postcode, 1, 3);
```
